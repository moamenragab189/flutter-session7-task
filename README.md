# Flutter Simple Product Detail Screen

A basic Flutter implementation of an e-commerce product detail page for a "Natural Red Apple."
This is a straightforward learning project focused on practicing core Flutter widgets and layout concepts.

## Project Overview

This single-screen app replicates a common mobile product view, including:
- Product image and name
- Quantity selector
- Price display
- Favorite icon
- Sections for product details, nutrition, and reviews
- "Add to Basket" button

The UI is intentionally simple and uses fundamental Material Design components. It is not fully responsive yet (fixed dimensions and padding are used), which is typical for initial learning prototypes.

## Preview

*(Add your own screenshots here by creating a `screenshots/` folder and placing images, e.g., `screenshot1.png`. Run the app on an emulator/device and capture them.)*
